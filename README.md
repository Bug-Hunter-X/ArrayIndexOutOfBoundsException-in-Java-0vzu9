# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range, causing this exception.

The `bugSolution.java` file shows how to fix this by checking array bounds before accessing elements.

This simple example is useful for understanding basic array handling in Java and avoiding common runtime errors.
